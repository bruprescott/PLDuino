# PLDuino
PLDuino controller's repository for code, docs and other related stuff.

Please consider trying Arduino/ESP8266.
It allows to develop for both Mega2560 and ESP8266 using Arduino IDE - in a more friendly way, compared to NodeMCU tools.
Here are the installation instructions: https://github.com/digitalloggers/plduino-arduinoide-package/blob/master/README.md
